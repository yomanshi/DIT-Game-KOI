# DIT-Game-KOI

Versions are kept as text document files due to the high storage usage of previous versions (AS A UNITY PACKAGE), such as v.0.1 being close to 250 MB.
Each text doc has a link to download each version through a drive link if needed.

Each version before v1.3.1 to fully work will need presets of Layers and Inputs and the ProBuilder addon in the Unity Package Manager applied to the Input Manager. Before v1.3.1, no character controller was scripted as one was taken from an asset store. Post this iteration we restarted and made our own.

Every script file will be in folder of version name in drive link as well. Only character controller will be in github code .
